## A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL WHCH PREDICTS THE PRICES OF HOUSES...

After thorough feature engineering and data viualization, where-in I identified features which directly surged or dwindled the prices of houses such as 
* level appartment(s) completion
* availability of air-conditioning, gest rooms, basement, hot water heater
* houses cited at reserved areas and
* nearness to main road,

I ran the sample data through a few models amongst which the Lasso regression model came out tops in terms of a closely superior r2_score on test data in comparison with the Linear regression algorithm.

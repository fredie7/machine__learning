#### This made use of a collection of data, spanning various column features such as pregnancie, glucose level, bloodPressure, skin thickness,insulin,BMI(body mass index),diabetes, pedigree function and age.


#### A tactful feature engineering was carried out to weigh the number of positive diabetic cases against the population.

#### A sample of data is tested to confirm that the model is corroborative
